# How to install Numix on Archlinux

## Install

Get [numix-themes](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/numix-themes/):

> yaourt -S numix-themes

## Use

Open `/usr/share/gtk-2.0/gtkrc` for gtk2 and `/usr/share/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` for gtk3

Replace the old theme with Numix. In my case, I switched from `Adwaita` to `Numix`.

As always, just read the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK%2B#Themes) for more informations.
