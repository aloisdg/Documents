From the start of human communication, we have to emphasis some part of our text. We use punctuation and intonation, but sometimes we need more to share a specific part of our message.  When we talk we can speak louder or soft. When we write we start to use basic kind of typo like bolding or italic. Whe use emoji too but here we dont really care. When we reach the web, we toke it with us. Most of Markup language implement it. You can use bold or italic in HTML, XAML, BBCode or Markdown ...
