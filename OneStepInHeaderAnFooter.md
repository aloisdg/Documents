# One step in header and footer

## Introduction

For the Epitech Innovative Project, we are told to rebuild our documents' header and footer. I never though about the importance of this two parts of a page, lets write something about this.

## Header and Footer are metadata

I don't really know. Well, everything related to the document outside of the document content itself. When I read a printed document what I love to know? Lets build a list :

* What document am I reading?
* Which chapter is this?
* Where should I put this paper in the whole document?
* When was the last publication of the document?
* What is the last version of the document?
* What is the name of the document?
* Who authored the document?
* What is the licence of the document?

Now, split the list in two tables.
