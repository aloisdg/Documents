# One Step in Header and Footer

## Introduction

For the Epitech Innovative Project, we are told to rebuild our documents' header and footer. I never though about the importance of this two parts of a page, lets write something about this.

## Header and Footer are metadata

### Content

I don't really know. Well, everything related to the document outside of the document content itself. When I read a printed document what I love to know? Lets build a list :

* What document am I reading?
* Which chapter is this?
* Where should I put this paper in the whole document?
* When was the last publication of the document?
* What is the last version of the document?
* What is the name of the document?
* Who authored the document?
* What is the licence of the document?

Now, split the list in two tables.

### Header

Title | Question | Example
----- | -------- | -------
Title | What document am I reading? | One step in header and footer
Chapter\* | Which chapter is this? | header and Footer content
Author\*\* | Who authored the document? | Alois de Gouvello

\* Chapter is optionnal. Add it if it is pertinent in your case. 

\*\* Author could be the logo of your team.

### Footer

Title | Question | Example
----- | -------- | -------
Page | Where should I put this paper in the whole document? | 13 / 42
Date | When was the last publication of the document? | 12-05-2015
Version | What is the last version of the document? | 2.1.0
