## Abstract

This section should give an abstract of the project work being carried out. In this section you can mention the exact problem statement. Ex: Numeral Recognition and Validation in Check Images is a process of .......... The extracted bank identification number, identification of bank agency, cheque number and account number from the image are validated against .................. These modules along with the other modules such as .................... (amount written in words) and amount validation module are used to set up a fully functional automatic bank cheque processing system.

## Introduction

An introduction to the area of work, explaining all the important aspects. Atleast one page introduction to the domain should be given. This section can have three to four Paragraphs of text. Explanation about the existing system need for change can also be included in this section. Example: Bank cheque processing is a challenging task for the scientific com-munity in the field of document analysis and character recognition. The challenge is because of the nature of the cheques.  Bank cheques ......................and identification of bank agency, the cheque number and ........................... size text style colour and so on. Usually the some of the information mentioned above are encoded as a number and are pre-printed using ............he most important user-entered information fields are the courtesy (digit) amount, the legal (worded) amount and the ............................... ...... Machine printed numeral recognition module. In a MICR cheque the numerals are printed using magnetic ink CMC-7 code. The major MICR fonts used around the world are E-13B and CMC-7. The code is printed in a well-defined zone. Therefore this task is mu...................er reference database the personal information about the customer. Courtesy amount recognition mod-ule. It is used for extracting numerals written by the user in the Courtesy amount field. The output of this module will be used by the amount validation module.

List the advanatages of the work...... This would reduce the manual work.... increase effieciency.........  Cost involved ............  implementation time for automation is minimal

## Motivation for the proposed work

Drawbacks observed in the existing system. What is the need of the proposed work can be stated here Applications of the proposed work can be listed.

## Objectives

Main objectives can be listed with bulletted points.

Example:

The Main Objective of the work are ..............

To recognize the graphics components in an image by extract ..............

To find the defective images.........................................

To Enhance........................

Compare and analyze ..................................

## Technical Details

Two to three paragraphs of technical details such as functional components of the system, details about the technologies used, security issues or any other technical details about the project can be explained. Also technical feasibility can be exaplined.

Example: Feature selection module: features carrying information about emotion is necessary for emotion recognition. Study on emotion of speech indicates that pitch, energy, duration, formant, Mel prediction cestrum coefficient (MPCC) and linear prediction.

Example: Feature reduction module: featu...............................n recognition. Study on emotion of speech indicates that pitch, energy, du...........and linear prediction
